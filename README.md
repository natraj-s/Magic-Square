A Magic Square is a nxn square grid filled with distinct positive integers in the range 1 to n^2. Each cell contains a different integer and the sum of the integers in each row, column and diagonal is equal. 

This program recreates the game faithfully for odd-number-dimensioned grids (1x1, 3x3, 5x5, etc.). The game initially takes from you, the user, an input for its dimensions. After presenting you with the UI, you can click Start and begin a game. The game will time you and also store your times locally. It is also capable of giving you hints by filling in unfilled blocks. 

The main class of the program is MagicSquareUI.java, so once you've downloaded this program, you can start the game by compiling and running MagicSquareUI.java. 

Have fun.
